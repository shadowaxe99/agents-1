Given the diverse nature of the agents and their respective tech stacks, there are few shared dependencies across all files. However, some commonalities can be identified:

1. **Dockerfile:** Each agent has a Dockerfile for creating a Docker image. This file will contain instructions for building the Docker image, such as the base image, working directory, copying files, installing dependencies, and the command to run the application.

2. **Main Application Files:** Each agent has a main application file (`main.py` or `main.js`). This file will contain the primary logic for the agent, including defining routes/endpoints, handling requests, and calling utility functions.

3. **Utility Files:** Each agent has a utility file (`utils.py` or `utils.js`). This file will contain helper functions that are used by the main application file. The functions in these files may include data processing, error handling, and interacting with APIs or libraries.

4. **Dependency Files:** Each agent has a file for managing dependencies (`requirements.txt` or `package.json`). These files will list the libraries or packages that the agent requires to function.

5. **Deployment Platforms:** The agents are deployed on various platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku, and Vercel. These platforms will require specific configurations, which may be defined in the Dockerfile or other configuration files.

6. **Languages:** Python and Node.js are the primary programming languages used across the agents. Shared elements may include standard language constructs, such as function definitions, variable declarations, and import statements.

7. **Libraries and APIs:** Several libraries and APIs are used across multiple agents, such as Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, Google Cloud APIs, and more. These will be imported and used in similar ways across the agents.

Please note that the specific names of exported variables, data schemas, DOM element IDs, message names, and function names will depend on the individual implementation of each agent and are not shared across all files.
